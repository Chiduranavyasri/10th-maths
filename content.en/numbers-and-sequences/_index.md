![Ramanujan](image.png)

Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematical genius who was born in Erode in a poor family. He was a child prodigy
and made calculations at lightning speed. He produced thousands
of precious formulae, jotting them on his three notebooks which
are now preserved at the University of Madras. With the help of
several notable men, he became the first research scholar in the
mathematics department of University of Madras. Subsequently,
he went to England and collaborated with G.H. Hardy for five years
from 1914 to 1919 .
